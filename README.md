# RISC-1200-processor
This project serves to simulate and validate the behavior of a RISC processor in Verilog, demonstrating the sequential execution of instructions through multiple pipeline stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write Back). It includes handling of basic ALU operations, immediate operations, memory accesses, and branch instructions.
